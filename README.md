**Extractive Question Answering and Re-ranking System**

 **Overview**

This project focuses on two important Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks:

- Extractive Question Answering (QA)
- Passage Re-ranking

The project explores how information retrieval and transformer-based models can be combined to retrieve relevant passages and extract accurate answers from text.

 **Project Components**

 **1. Extractive Question Answering**

The extractive QA component predicts an answer span directly from a given context passage.

 Dataset Used
- SQuAD v1.1

 Features
- Context preprocessing
- Tokenization
- Answer span prediction
- Evaluation using:
  - Exact Match (EM)
  - F1 Score


 **2. Passage Re-ranking**

The re-ranking component improves retrieval quality by ranking candidate passages according to their relevance to a query.

 Dataset Used
- MS MARCO Dataset

The dataset was imported directly during runtime and was not stored locally in the repository.

 Features
- Query-passage relevance scoring
- Passage ranking
- Transformer-based reranking workflow
- Retrieval quality improvement


 Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn



**Workflow**
Extractive QA Pipeline
Load SQuAD dataset
Preprocess contexts and questions
Tokenize text
Train/evaluate QA model
Predict answer spans
Compute EM and F1 metrics
Re-ranking Pipeline
Load query-passage pairs from MS MARCO
Generate candidate passages
Compute relevance scores
Re-rank retrieved passages
Return top-ranked passages

**Running the Project**

Open the notebook using Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab and run the cells sequentially.

Future Improvements
Dense retrieval models
Semantic search with embeddings
Hybrid retrieval systems
API deployment
Web interface integration
Advanced reranking architectures
